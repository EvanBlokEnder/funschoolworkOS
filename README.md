# nautilusos

a fully functional web-based operating system that runs entirely in your browser. no installation required, no backend needed - just pure html, css, and javascript creating a complete desktop environment with file management, applications, and customization options.

## overview

nautilusos is a comprehensive web-based os that provides a complete desktop computing experience. it features a bootloader, login system, draggable windows, a virtual file system, and over a dozen built-in applications. everything is stored locally using browser storage, making it perfect for use as a distraction-free environment, a learning tool, or just for fun.

the os includes both graphical and command-line interfaces, customizable themes, profile management, and even tab cloaking for privacy. all your data persists between sessions, and you can export/import your entire profile to backup or share your setup.

built entirely from scratch with no frameworks or dependencies (except font awesome for icons), nautilusos demonstrates what's possible with modern web technologies.
