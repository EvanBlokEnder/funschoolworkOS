## NautilusOS

NautilusOS is a web-based operating system built entirely in HTML, CSS, and JSâ€”and itâ€™s my biggest project yet!!  
Boot it up, log in, and mess around like itâ€™s a real desktop with apps, an app store, windows, a file explorer, taskbar, and more.

## âœ¨ features

Thereâ€™s a ton to play with, but hereâ€™s a quick rundown (seriously, check them all out yourself):

- bootloader, account setup, and login screen  
- fully animated desktop environment  
- draggable + resizable windows  
- taskbar with running app indicators  
- start menu with user info and apps grid  
- file explorer with folders, files, and side tree  
- built-in text editor  
- super duper cool proxied browser
- cloaking and various other settings 
- terminal
- built-in app store
- exportable profiles
- context menus  
- startup and tools panels  
- smooth transitions, gradients, and clean UI  

Basically... a whole little OS in your browser :D

## ðŸ’¡ more about

This is mostly just a fun UI sandbox with no backend or external data storage. It just seemed like the logical next step after Helios Browser.  
Everything runs client-side.  
Built with just HTML, CSS, and JS (no frameworks, no CDNs except icons/fonts)

---

## ðŸ§  try it

Open the HTML file in your browser. Thatâ€™s it.
